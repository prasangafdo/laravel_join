# laravel_join
Join queries with laravel without any database relationships

This repository contains an example join query without relationships in Laravel.
It will retrieve the data from different tables using the foreign key constrains and will display in a table.
It includes select where clauses as well.

Models, Controllers and Migrations aren't configured properly. Consider using the Migrations in the "Laravel_test" repository.
